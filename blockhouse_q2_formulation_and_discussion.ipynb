    "- Using real snapshots from the limit order book, we fit power-law models of the form $g_t(x) = a x^{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "- Across the three stocks, all estimated $\\alpha$ values were less than 1, confirming the concavity of market impact.\n",
    "- The stock **CRWV** displayed the steepest curve, meaning its slippage is more sensitive to trade size."
